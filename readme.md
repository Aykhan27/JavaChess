# Java Chess Game

## Overview

This Java Chess Game is a sophisticated console-based application that simulates a full chess game, implementing all standard chess rules, including piece movement, castling, pawn promotion, and check/checkmate detection. Designed with an emphasis on object-oriented principles, the game provides a robust platform for understanding complex software interactions and security considerations within game development.

## Features

- **Piece-Specific Movement Logic**: Each chess piece (Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King) follows its unique movement rules, ensuring an authentic chess experience.
- **Check and Checkmate Detection**: The game accurately detects check and checkmate scenarios, providing a realistic challenge to players.
- **Castling Support**: The game supports castling, adding depth to strategic gameplay.
- **Pawn Promotion**: Pawns reaching the opposite side of the board are automatically promoted to Queens, reflecting standard chess rules.
- **Stalemate and Draw Detection**: The game can detect stalemate situations and insufficient material conditions, leading to a draw.

## Structure

The game is structured into multiple classes, each representing a piece on the chessboard or a component of the game's logic:

- **Piece Classes**: `Pawn`, `Knight`, `Bishop`, `Rook`, `Queen`, `King`
- **Utility Classes**: `Board`, `Game`, `Color`
- **Main Class**: `Game`

## Getting Started

To run the game, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Compile the Java files and run the `Game` class:

```bash
javac Game.java
java Game
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to make your moves. The game uses algebraic notation to represent each square on the chessboard (e.g., `e4`, `d5`).

## Security Considerations

As a penetration tester with a decade of experience, it's crucial to consider the security implications of running and developing a game like this:

- **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks or crashes.
- **Code Review**: Regularly review the codebase for vulnerabilities, particularly in the logic handling user inputs and game state transitions.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Adhere to secure coding standards to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the game's functionality or security are welcome. Please adhere to standard coding practices and provide thorough documentation for your contributions.
